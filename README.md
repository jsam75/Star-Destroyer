Springboard useEffect/useRef exercise

This was an exercise from the Sprinboard SEC course.  This one was more challenging than the card deck one.  This was also a dense session and I put a lot of notes in the code.  Still nothing left in my brain for error handling.  I just focused on functionality and the concepts of hooks.
